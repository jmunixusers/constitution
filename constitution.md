## Article I - Name of Organization

This organization shall be called the James Madison University Unix Users
Group. The Unix Users Group is also referred to as the UUG.

## Article II - Purpose of Organization

The Unix Users Group is an organization for users of UNIX-like systems, as well
as users and contributors of a wider open-source software ecosystem. The UUG
engages in education and advocacy in these areas, and encourages its members
to develop more effective ways of working with UNIX-like and open systems. The
UUG also emphasizes sharing of knowledge in these areas and contributing back
to the global computing community.

## Article III - Membership and Dues

Membership in this organization is open to all JMU students and will not be
restricted on the basis of age, ability, ethnicity, gender, national origin,
race, color, religion, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity,
or political affiliation except in circumstances outlined in federal and
state laws.

The UUG strives to maintain an open door policy for its meetings, so membership
is not required for attendance, and anyone from the university or wider
community may attend. Membership dues will be set by the officers during the
first business meeting, and membership will be open the first month of the
semester. Dues paying members will be eligible to vote in matters when the
officers deem it necessary. Members will also be eligible to run for officer
positions.

Caution will be taken to not make dues a financial burden. Officers may grant
exemptions on a case-by-case basis to members experiencing a hardship, with
consideration given to the member's past and expected contributions to club
meetings and projects.

Membership will be revoked by ½ vote of officers plus ¾ vote from the general
membership if actions are deemed inappropriate by the membership. Dues are
non-refundable, regardless of voluntary membership termination or revocation.  
Once a person's membership has been revoked (whether paid or not), they shall
not attend any future meetings.

## Article IV - Officers

Election of officers will require a majority vote from the general membership.
The term of office will be one full year, from April to April, though outgoing
officers should spend the remainder of the year ensuring the incoming officers
are prepared for their new duties. All officers shall comprise the Executive
Committee of the organization. The Executive Committee shall meet in addition
to regular organization meetings. The officers and individual duties shall be:

- President
  - Set meeting schedule and preside over all meetings
  - Ensure that the organization is operating in conformity with the standards
  set forth by James Madison University and the Office of Student Activities &
  Involvement
  - Cosign organization checks with Treasurer
  - Maintain communication with organization adviser

- Vice-president
  - Preside over meetings in the absence of the President
  - Coordinate organization online projects, such as open-source repositories

- Secretary
  - Maintain an accurate record of business meetings
  - Correspond with members and send meeting announcements

- Treasurer
  - Maintain accurate record of organization transactions
  - Collect dues if required, and record membership roster
  - Develop organization budget for club approval

  - Arrange fundraising opportunities for the organization

All officers are expected to help promote the organization around campus, and
take on additional duties as necessary for the operation of the UUG, as
determined by their fellow officers.

Officers may be removed from office by ½ vote of the other officers and ¾ of
the general membership if actions are deemed inappropriate by the membership.

## Article V - Adviser

The adviser(s) shall be a faculty or staff member at James Madison University.
The adviser will assume those responsibilities as outlined in this constitution
and/or found in University Policy No. 3101 entitled "Faculty Advisers to
Student Organizations."

The adviser will be selected by a ½ vote of the Executive Committee and then
presented to the general membership for a ¾ vote. Advisers not fulfilling
responsibilities or abiding by the organization's purpose may be removed from
the position by a ½ vote of the officers. The officers must have a bonafide
offer from a substitute adviser before beginning removal proceedings. The
adviser shall have the following responsibilites:

- Call business meetings as necessary
- Ensure the officers provide effective leadership of the club
- Exercise the powers of the officers in case of an emergency
- Call for officer nominations and conduct elections annually
- Audit club finances

## Article VI - Meetings

The organization shall hold regular weekly meetings during the academic term
except when holidays, examination periods, or other events make meeting
impractical. The meeting day/time will be determined at the beginning of each
semester by the officers, with advice from members.

The officers shall hold business meetings as necessary through the semester,
to plan content and strategy for the regular meetings and club projects. The
outcomes and decisions of these meetings shall be presented to the club members
at a regular meeting as necessary and appropriate.

## Article VII - Hazing

Unix Users Group, in keeping with JMU's expectations for a positive academic
and social environment, unconditionally opposes hazing. No individual member of
our group or the group itself may engage in or plan any activity that may be
defined as hazing.

Unix Users Group opposes any situation created intentionally to produce mental
or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment or ridicule to its members
or potential members. In addition, no individual nor recognized organization
may, by physical or mental stress or by subtle or covert technique, impair,
make captive, or destroy an individual's freedom of thought and choice.

J17-100 Hazing - The university prohibits any situation created intentionally
to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment or ridicule
in connection with or the purpose of initiation, admission into, or affiliation
with or as a condition for continued membership in a club, organization, or
association, regardless of whether the students participated voluntarily in the
relevant activity. Students directing, engaging in, aiding, or participating
in, actively or passively, the forcing, compelling, requiring, encouraging,
expecting, whether direct or implied, of individuals to participate in hazing
activities shall be considered in violation of this policy.

It is impossible to anticipate every situation that could involve hazing.
Behavior listed below does not, and cannot encompass every circumstance that
can be categorized as hazing. Further, this policy is not intended to prohibit
customary athletic events, contests, and competitions that are sponsored by the
institution or the organized and supervised practices associated with such
events or activity or conduct that furthers the goals of a legitimate
educational curriculum, extracurricular program, or military training program
as approved by the University.

Hazing activities include but are not limited to; physical abuse; kidnapping,
blindfolding, confinement, or binding and/or restricting movement; calisthenics
or other strenuous physical activity used to harass, punish, or harm an
individual; excursions; spraying, painting, or pelting with any substance;
burying in any substance; nudity; servitude; exposure to uncomfortable elements;
verbal abuse or harassment; wearing of apparel which is conspicuous or indecent;
forcing consumption of any legal or illegal substance (e.g. food, liquid,
beverage, alcohol, drug, or other substance); depriving of sufficient sleep;
burning, branding, or tattooing; interrogation in an intimidating or threatening
manner; misleading members in an effort to convince them that they will not
become or remain members unless they complete tasks, follow instructions, or act
in a certain way; misleading members into believing that they will be hurt
during induction or initiation; carrying items that serve no constructive
purpose or that are designed to punish or embarrass the carrier; requiring or
suggesting obtaining, possessing items or completing tasks in an unlawful manner
(i.e. scavenger hunts); any act that is designed to or likely to compromise the
dignity of a member or prospective member, cause embarrassment or shame to a
member or prospective member, cause a member or prospective member to be the
object of malicious amusement, ridicule, or emotional strain, or cause
psychological harm or substantial emotional strain; or any other activity which
may result in physical injury or endanger the health or life of the individual
being hazed.

An individual cannot consent to being hazed; a victim's voluntary or willful
participation in hazing activities will not be considered evidence that a
violation of this policy did not occur. Section 18.2-56 of the Code of Virginia
declares hazing illegal, establishes conditions for civil and criminal
liability, and outlines the duties of the university when a student has been
found guilty of hazing in civil or criminal court.

It is hereby incorporated as part of this constitution and will serve as a guide
for action by the university and the Unix Users Group if there is an instance
of hazing by this organization or any of the members of this organization.  It
will be the duty of the officers of the Unix Users Group to educate the
membership of this policy.

## Article VIII - Amendments

Amendments to this constitution must be submitted in writing at a regular
meeting of the organization. Said amendment(s) will be voted on at a subsequent
meeting. In order to adopt the amendment, a vote of 2/3 of the general
membership is necessary.

In some situations, changes to the constitution may be mandated by the Office
of Student Activities and Involvement in order to retain good standing. These
changes should be announced at a regular meeting of the organization; however,
they do not need to be voted on by the membership.

## Article IX - Ratification

This constitution shall become effective upon approval by a ¾ vote of the
membership. Ratified constitutions must be uploaded to the Be Involved
organization page in a timely manner after substantial amendments and
submitted each year with Annual Organization Registration.

## Article X - Dissolution of Organization

In the event of dissolution of the Unix Users Group, the final officers and
advisors shall decide how to distribute remaining funds to organizations such
as other Computer Science clubs or local charities.
